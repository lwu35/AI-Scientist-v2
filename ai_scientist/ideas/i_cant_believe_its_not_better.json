        "Short Hypothesis": "Introducing a compositional regularization term during training can encourage neural networks to develop compositional representations, thereby improving their ability to generalize to novel combinations of known components.",
        "Related Work": "Previous work has highlighted the challenges neural networks face in achieving compositional generalization. Studies such as 'Compositional Generalization through Abstract Representations in Human and Artificial Neural Networks' (Ito et al., NeurIPS 2022) have explored abstract representations to tackle this issue. However, limited research focuses on directly incorporating explicit regularization terms into the training objective to enforce compositional structures. Our proposal distinguishes itself by introducing a novel regularization approach that penalizes deviations from predefined compositional patterns during training, encouraging the network to internalize compositional rules.",
        "Abstract": "Neural networks excel in many tasks but often struggle with compositional generalization\u2014the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of familiar components. This limitation hampers their performance on tasks requiring systematic generalization beyond the training data. In this proposal, we introduce a novel training method that incorporates an explicit compositional regularization term into the loss function of neural networks. This regularization term is designed to encourage the formation of compositional representations by penalizing the network when its internal representations deviate from expected compositional structures. We hypothesize that this approach will enhance the network's ability to generalize to unseen combinations, mimicking human-like compositional reasoning. We will test our method on synthetic benchmarks like the SCAN and COGS datasets, which are specifically designed to evaluate compositional generalization, as well as on real-world tasks such as machine translation and semantic parsing. By comparing our method to baseline models and existing approaches, we aim to demonstrate significant improvements in generalization performance. This work offers a new avenue for enforcing compositionality in neural networks through regularization, potentially bridging the gap between neural network capabilities and human cognitive flexibility.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Explanation methods for deep learning models may not always provide accurate or reliable interpretations of model behavior; identifying when these methods fail can inform better application and development of interpretability techniques.",
        "Related Work": "Previous studies, such as 'Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps' (Adebayo et al., 2018) and 'The (Un)reliability of Saliency Methods' (Kindermans et al., 2017), have highlighted issues with the reliability of certain interpretability methods. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the failure modes of explanation techniques across different models and tasks, especially in practical, real-world settings. Our proposal distinguishes itself by providing a comprehensive analysis of when and why interpretability methods fail, and how they may mislead users.",
        "Abstract": "Interpretability methods are essential for understanding and trusting deep learning models, especially in critical applications where insight into model decisions is necessary. However, these methods may not always provide accurate or meaningful explanations of a model's behavior, and can sometimes be misleading. This proposal aims to investigate the limitations and failure modes of popular interpretability techniques in deep learning, such as saliency maps, attribution methods, and concept activation vectors. We hypothesize that these methods can fail due to factors like model architecture, data biases, or adversarial manipulations, leading to explanations that do not reflect the true decision-making processes of the models. Through systematic experiments across various tasks and models, we will analyze the reliability of interpretability methods, identify conditions under which they fail, and propose metrics to assess explanation fidelity. The findings will inform practitioners about the potential pitfalls of relying on current interpretability techniques and guide the development of more robust methods to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems.",
