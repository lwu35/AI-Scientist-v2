        "Short Hypothesis": "Can language models improve user experience by dynamically adapting their behavior and responses based on real-time contextual user behavior, rather than relying on static pre-defined personas? This hypothesis posits that real-time contextual adaptation can provide more relevant and satisfactory interactions compared to static personas, while also mitigating potential biases and harmful behaviors.",
        "Related Work": "Current models often rely on static personas, which are pre-defined character profiles used to guide the model's behavior. Existing work in real-time personalization primarily focuses on recommendation systems rather than LLMs. Studies have shown that static personas can be exploited through adversarial prompts, leading to harmful behaviors. This proposal distinguishes itself by focusing on real-time contextual adaptation, which has not been extensively explored in the context of LLMs. Unlike static personas, this approach aims to dynamically adjust responses based on user behavior and interaction context.",

This method aims to provide more nuanced and contextually appropriate interactions, while also mitigating the risks associated with static personas.
